### Beginner Tutorial: Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Simple Non-Biological (Inorganic) Molecular Systems Using Gromacs

This repository currently includes a tutorial to generate force field parameters for TAEA amine, followed by molecular dynamics simulations of this amine with various other molecules such as water etc. using Gromacs.

The tutorial-1 described in folder "1_beginner_tutorial_taea_amine", which further contains three folders:

1. optimize_structure_Gaussian
2. charges_gaff
3. gromacs_simulation

Names of these folders are self-explanatory. For a detailed description, please refer to the corresponding google doc file.

Tutorial-2 focuses on setting up polymer simualations. Details are provided in the README file located in that folder.
