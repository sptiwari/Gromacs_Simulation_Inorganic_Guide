### Beginner Tutorial: Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Simple Non-Biological (Inorganic) Molecular Systems Using Gromacs

This repository currently includes a tutorial to generate force field parameters for TAEA amine, followed by molecular dynamics simulations of this amine with various other molecules such as water etc. using Gromacs.

The tutorial is described in folder "1_beginner_tutorial_taea_amine", which further contains three folders:

1. optimize_structure_Gaussian
2. charges_gaff
3. gromacs_simulation

Names of these folders are self-explanatory. For a detailed description, please refer to the corresponding google doc file.
