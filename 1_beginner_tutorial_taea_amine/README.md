### Beginner Tutorial 1: Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Simple Non-Biological (Inorganic) Molecular Systems Using Gromacs

This tutorial focuses on creating force field parameters for TAEA amine, followed by its molecular dynamics simulation along with various other molecules such as water, CO2 and N2 molecules using Gromacs.

This folder contains three subfolders.

1. optimize_structure_Gaussian
2. charges_gaff
3. gromacs_simulation

Names of these folders are self-explanatory. For a detailed description, please refer to the corresponding google doc file.

Tutorial-2 focuses on setting up polymer simualations. Details are provided in the README file located in that folder.
